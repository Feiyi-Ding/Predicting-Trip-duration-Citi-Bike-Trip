**The [PDF](https://github.com/Feiyi-Ding/Portfolio/blob/main/CitiBike_MachineLearning/CitiBikeTrip.pdf) file is the best way to view this project!**

* Description
<p>This dataset contains information about Citi bike rides in NYC including information about the destinations of bike rides, time of ride, distance, and activity level at diï¬€erent bike stations. Given the large size of the datasets, I only focuses on one month of data in 2020. The goal of this dataset is to predict the trip duration of the ride.</p>
